          <p>The Philippines has strongly denied a Chinese state media report claiming that China’s coast guard seized control of Sandy Cay, a disputed reef near Thitu Island (Pag‑asa) in the West Philippine Sea.</p>
          <p>Tensions between Manila and Beijing have escalated over the South China Sea, where China claims nearly the entire area despite an international ruling rejecting its claims.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, joint US‑Philippines military exercises (Balikatan) involve large‑scale drills including integrated air and missile defense simulations. The United States’ growing military presence and activities in the region have drawn sharp criticism from Beijing, which accuses Manila of "colluding with outside powers" and warns that the exercises threaten regional stability.</p>

          <p>According to Chinese state media, China’s coast guard seized control of Sandy Cay (Tiexian Reef), a disputed sandbank near the Philippine military base on Thitu Island in the West Philippine Sea. China claims it is exercising sovereignty by inspecting and planting a flag in the area; however, there is no sign of permanent occupation.</p>
          <p>This event follows the recent increase in tensions resulting from the Philippines and the US conducting their Balikatan joint military drills. China claims that this act by the United States is destabilizing the region. Both Beijing and Manila have recently blamed each other for environmental damage in contested areas.</p>

        <div class="news-full" hidden>
          <p>As covered in the previous week, the United States is deploying its NMESIS (Navy‑Marine Expeditionary Ship Interdiction System) missile launchers to Batanes and other parts of northern Luzon during this year's Balikatan military exercises with the Philippines.</p>
          <p>However, former Batanes Rep. Florencio "Butch" Abad warned that the deployment could endanger Batanes and its residents (the Ivatans), as the province is geographically close to Taiwan.</p>
          <p>He expressed concerns that in the event of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, Batanes could suffer significant collateral damage, given the critical importance of the nearby Bashi Channel for global trade and the potential for military conflict involving sophisticated weaponry.</p>
          <p>This shows how innocent residents could be caught mid‑conflict, which has been evident since the colonization of the Philippines.</p>

          <p>The United States has deployed its NMESIS anti-ship missile system to the Philippines for the Balikatan exercises. This move aims to boost deterrence in the region due to the ongoing regional tensions, especially with China.</p>
          <p>This action also aims to prove confidence between the two nations bound by the Mutual Defense Treaty that requires each other’s defense in case of an armed attack, which took effect shortly after the Philippines attained independence. This is evidence of the ever-present United States in the Philippines since the colonial period.</p>

          <p>The US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced that the US will deploy more advanced assets to the Philippines which include the Navy/Marine Expeditionary Ship Interdiction System (NMESIS) and unmanned surface vessels.</p>
          <p>This announcement signifies how the US is committed to its military influence in the region despite the PH having gained independence years ago. The continued military alliance and financial support show the enduring American strategic interests in the region. These ties influence the ability of the Philippines military to work independently and make sovereign decisions amidst ongoing geopolitical tensions in the Indo‑Pacific.</p>

          <p>The US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth visited the Philippines to emphasize that the US administration is committed to continue its “ironclad” alliance with the Philippines. This visit highlights the continuing ties between the US and the PH.</p>
          <p>In the article, the emphasis on maintaining an “ironclad” military and economic alliance reflects historical patterns of U.S. strategic interests in the region. The U.S interest in the Philippines is rooted in America's former colonial administration and ongoing geopolitical considerations in the region which involve security issues related to the presence of Chinese navy in the South China Sea.</p>

          <p>This week's news adds to the ongoing tensions in the West Philippine Sea, where recently, Chinese state media urged PH to remove the United States's Typhon missile system from the South China Sea. However, the Philippines president refused the removal of the missile system asserting its sovereignty.</p>
          <p>This situation highlights the Philippines' entanglement with its former colonizer, the US. The U.S. colonization established deep military roots in the region which exist to date and continues to shape the affairs of the Philippines. Furthermore, the existing military partnerships today reinforce American presence in the Philippines, leading to questions about true independence and self‑determination.</p>

          <p>After President Trump took office, the Trump administration froze foreign aid, mostly for security and counternarcotics programs. However, the administration exempted some of its foreign military assistance funds to the Philippines, reaffirming both nations' commitment to their military treaty.</p>
          <p>According to the response of the Philippine Ambassador to the United States Jose Manuel Romualdez, the Philippines seemed pleased with the news. This shows deep‑rooted dependence on the United States rooted in colonial history. This understanding allows the United States access to agreed locations in the PH on a rotational basis for security cooperation exercises and combined military activities.</p>

          <p>Recently, at this year's Munich Security Conference, the Philippines Foreign Affairs Secretary Enrique Manalo emphasized that the Philippines exercises its rights when conducting activities in its exclusive economic zone (EEZ). He raised concerns about other nations applying their domestic laws to areas within the Philippines EEZ, increasing tensions, and implicitly pointing to China's extensive claims in the South China Sea that overlap with Philippine EEZs.</p>

          <p>President Trump decided to withdraw the US from the World Health Organization (WHO). According to former Philippine Health Secretary Janette Garin, this decision would negatively affect the Philippines because many WHO programs there are supported by USAID.</p>
          <p>The US has positioned itself as a principal authority on global health by providing resources to countries like the Philippines. Its exit from WHO reflects a continuity of prioritizing American interests first—a pattern rooted in its colonial history—and may undermine the Philippines’ health sovereignty by leaving funding gaps in critical health programs.</p>
